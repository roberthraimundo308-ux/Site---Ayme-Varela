## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Chocolate Brown (#3D1D13) to convey warmth and richness.
- Background color: Light Beige (#F5F5F5) to provide a soft and inviting backdrop.
- Accent color: Pale Pink (#d6a9a3) for subtle highlights and to complement the chocolate brown.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', a serif font that harmonizes art, design and fashion. For body text use 'Alegreya'.
- Use minimalist icons from Lucide React to maintain a clean and modern aesthetic.
- Employ a grid-based layout for product and gallery sections to organize content effectively. Use a card layout to clearly present each cake design.
- Subtle animations, such as fade-ins and slide-ups, when transitioning between sections or displaying new content to engage users without being intrusive.
